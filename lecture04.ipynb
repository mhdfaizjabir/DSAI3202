    "Summary:\n",
    "t1 is explicitly named, while t2 uses a default name.\n",
    "Both threads execute the same function in parallel.\n",
    "The program uses .start() to begin thread execution and .join() to wait for their completion.\n",
    "The order of thread execution is not guaranteed due to concurrent execution, but both threads will independently print their start and end messages."

    "Difference Between Lock and RLock:\n",
    "Lock (Basic Lock):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A Lock (short for mutex or mutual exclusion) is the simplest form of synchronization primitive.\n",
    "Behavior: It is a basic locking mechanism where a thread acquires a lock, and no other thread can proceed until the lock is released.\n",
    "Usage: A Lock can only be acquired once by a thread. If the same thread attempts to acquire the lock again (while holding it), it will block (and potentially cause a deadlock).\n",
    "Unlocking: Only the thread that acquired the lock can release it.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Lock when a thread only needs to acquire the lock once and when you do not expect recursive locking (i.e., the same thread acquiring the same lock multiple times).\n",

    "# Thread tries to acquire lock twice, leading to deadlock\n",
    "lock.acquire()  # Acquired once\n",
    "lock.acquire()  # Deadlock here as it's already acquired\n",
    "RLock (Reentrant Lock):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: RLock (Reentrant Lock) is a more advanced locking mechanism that allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times (reentrantly), without causing a deadlock.\n",
    "Behavior: A thread that has already acquired an RLock can acquire it again without blocking itself. The lock keeps a count of how many times it has been acquired, and the thread must release it the same number of times to completely unlock it.\n",
    "Unlocking: The lock can be released as many times as it was acquired.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",

    "Use RLock when a thread needs to acquire the lock multiple times within the same scope (e.g., recursive functions or functions that call other functions that require the same lock).\n",
