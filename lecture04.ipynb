    "Summary:\n",
    "t1 is explicitly named, while t2 uses a default name.\n",

    "The program uses .start() to begin thread execution and .join() to wait for their completion.\n",
    "The order of thread execution is not guaranteed due to concurrent execution, but both threads will independently print their start and end messages."

    "Difference Between Lock and RLock:\n",
    "Lock (Basic Lock):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A Lock (short for mutex or mutual exclusion) is the simplest form of synchronization primitive.\n",
    "Behavior: It is a basic locking mechanism where a thread acquires a lock, and no other thread can proceed until the lock is released.\n",
    "Usage: A Lock can only be acquired once by a thread. If the same thread attempts to acquire the lock again (while holding it), it will block (and potentially cause a deadlock).\n",
    "Unlocking: Only the thread that acquired the lock can release it.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Lock when a thread only needs to acquire the lock once and when you do not expect recursive locking (i.e., the same thread acquiring the same lock multiple times).\n",

    "# Thread tries to acquire lock twice, leading to deadlock\n",
    "lock.acquire()  # Acquired once\n",
    "lock.acquire()  # Deadlock here as it's already acquired\n",
    "RLock (Reentrant Lock):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: RLock (Reentrant Lock) is a more advanced locking mechanism that allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times (reentrantly), without causing a deadlock.\n",
    "Behavior: A thread that has already acquired an RLock can acquire it again without blocking itself. The lock keeps a count of how many times it has been acquired, and the thread must release it the same number of times to completely unlock it.\n",
    "Unlocking: The lock can be released as many times as it was acquired.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",

    "Use RLock when a thread needs to acquire the lock multiple times within the same scope (e.g., recursive functions or functions that call other functions that require the same lock).\n",

    "Explanation of Code:\n",
    "The code demonstrates a classic producer-consumer problem, where one thread (the producer) generates items and puts them in a shared resource (a queue), and another thread (the consumer) takes items from that resource and processes them. A Condition object is used to synchronize the two threads to ensure that the consumer only consumes when items are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components:\n",
    "Condition Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "condition = threading.Condition()\n",
    "The Condition object provides a way for threads to communicate with each other.\n",
    "It allows one thread (e.g., the consumer) to wait until some condition (items being added to the queue) is met, and another thread (e.g., the producer) to notify that the condition has been met.\n",
    "Condition is typically used in conjunction with a shared resource (in this case, queue) to ensure thread-safe access.\n",
    "Shared Resource (queue):\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "queue = []\n",
    "queue is the shared resource between the producer and consumer. It holds items (integers in this case) that the producer adds, and the consumer removes.\n",
    "The queue is initially empty, meaning the consumer has nothing to consume at the start.\n",
    "Producer Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def producer():\n",
    "    with condition:\n",
    "        print(\"Producer adding items to the queue\")\n",
    "        queue.extend(range(5))  # Produce some items (0 to 4)\n",
    "        condition.notify_all()  # Notify the consumers that items are available\n",
    "The producer acquires the lock associated with the Condition object using the with condition: statement.\n",
    "It adds five items (0 to 4) to the queue using queue.extend(range(5)).\n",
    "After producing items, the producer notifies all waiting consumers using condition.notify_all(). This wakes up the consumer threads that are waiting on the condition, indicating that the queue is no longer empty.\n",
    "Consumer Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def consumer():\n",
    "    with condition:\n",
    "        while not queue:  # If the queue is empty, wait for items\n",
    "            condition.wait()  # Wait for the producer to notify\n",
    "        item = queue.pop(0)  # Consume an item\n",
    "        print(f\"Consumer got item: {item}\")\n",
    "The consumer also acquires the lock using with condition: before attempting to access the shared resource.\n",
    "The while not queue: ensures that the consumer waits when the queue is empty by calling condition.wait(). The consumer will remain blocked until the producer calls condition.notify_all().\n",
    "Once the consumer is notified, it pops an item from the queue and processes it by printing the item.\n",
    "Thread Creation and Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)\n",
    "consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)\n",
    "\n",
    "consumer_thread.start()\n",
    "producer_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "producer_thread.join()\n",
    "consumer_thread.join()\n",
    "Two threads are created: one for the producer and one for the consumer.\n",
    "The consumer starts first, but it waits for the producer to add items to the queue because the queue is initially empty.\n",
    "The producer runs next, adds items to the queue, and notifies the consumer, allowing the consumer to process the items.\n",
    "The join() method ensures that the main program waits for both threads to finish before terminating.\n",
    "Flow of Execution:\n",
    "Consumer Starts First:\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer thread starts first and tries to consume an item from the queue. Since the queue is initially empty, it waits for the producer by calling condition.wait().\n",
    "Producer Adds Items:\n",
    "\n",
    "The producer thread starts and adds five items to the queue. After adding the items, the producer notifies the consumer by calling condition.notify_all().\n",
    "Consumer Resumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "After being notified, the consumer wakes up and pops an item from the queue. It prints the item it consumed and finishes execution.\n",
    "Synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Condition ensures that the consumer doesn’t try to consume from an empty queue and only proceeds when there are items available.\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "arduino\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Producer adding items to the queue\n",
    "Consumer got item: 0\n",
    "In this case, the producer adds five items, but the consumer only processes the first item (0) before the threads finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Producer: Generates and adds items to the queue.\n",
    "Consumer: Waits for items and consumes them from the queue.\n",
    "Condition: Ensures that the consumer waits for the producer to generate items before consuming, thus avoiding issues like race conditions and deadlocks."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This function represents a thread that waits for the event to be set before continuing its execution.\n",
    "It first prints \"Thread is waiting for the event to be set.\"\n",
    "The call to event.wait() makes the thread block until the event is set. It waits until the event’s internal flag becomes True (i.e., when event.set() is called by another thread).\n",
    "Once the event is set, the thread resumes execution and prints \"Event has been set, thread continues execution.\"\n",
    "Creating and Starting Threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two threads are created:\n",
    "setter_thread: This thread runs the event_setter() function to set the event after a delay.\n",
    "listener_thread: This thread runs the event_listener() function, which waits for the event to be set.\n",
    "Both threads are started with start(), which begins their execution in parallel.\n",
    "Waiting for Threads to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "The join() method is called on both threads to ensure that the main program waits for both threads to finish their work before exiting.\n",
    "Flow of Execution:\n",
    "Initial State:\n",
    "\n",
    "listener_thread starts first and immediately waits for the event to be set.\n",
    "setter_thread starts, simulates some work by sleeping for 3 seconds.\n",

    "\n",
    "After 3 seconds, setter_thread sets the event, which unblocks the listener_thread.\n",
    "Thread Synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the event is set, the listener_thread resumes execution and completes.\n",
    "Completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both threads finish, and the program terminates after join() ensures that both threads are done.\n",
    "Use Cases of threading.Event:\n",
    "Managing Start/Stop Operations: It’s ideal for situations where threads need to wait for some condition or event before they proceed.\n",
    "Signaling Between Threads: One thread can signal another to start processing or continue its execution.\n",

    "Here’s a detailed explanation of the provided code, which implements a basic **Producer-Consumer** problem using Python's `Queue` and `threading` modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Producer-Consumer Problem**: \n",
    "   - **Producer**: Generates data and places it into a queue.\n",
    "   - **Consumer**: Takes data out of the queue and processes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Queue**: The `Queue` is a thread-safe FIFO (First In First Out) data structure provided by Python. It allows one thread (the producer) to safely add items, while another thread (the consumer) safely removes and processes items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Threading**: This allows multiple threads to run concurrently, enabling parallel execution of producer and consumer tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from queue import Queue\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `Queue`: A thread-safe data structure.\n",
    "   - `threading`: Provides the ability to create and manage threads.\n",
    "   - `time`: Used for adding delays (simulating the time taken to produce/consume items).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating the Queue**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   data_queue = Queue()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `Queue()` initializes a new queue instance. This will act as a shared buffer between the producer and the consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Producer Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def producer():\n",
    "       for i in range(5):\n",
    "           data_queue.put(i)  # Add item to the queue\n",
    "           print(f\"Produced {i}\")\n",
    "           time.sleep(1)  # Simulate production delay\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `producer()` function creates and puts 5 items (0 to 4) into the `data_queue` using the `put()` method.\n",
    "   - `time.sleep(1)` simulates the time taken to produce an item (1 second delay between items).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consumer Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def consumer():\n",
    "       while True:\n",
    "           item = data_queue.get()  # Get item from the queue\n",
    "           print(f\"Consumed {item}\")\n",
    "           data_queue.task_done()  # Mark task as completed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `consumer()` function continuously consumes items from the `data_queue`.\n",
    "   - It retrieves items using the `get()` method, which blocks until an item is available.\n",
    "   - After processing each item, `task_done()` is called to indicate that the item has been fully processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Setting Up Producer and Consumer Threads**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)\n",
    "   consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer, daemon=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Two threads are created:\n",
    "     - `producer_thread` runs the `producer` function.\n",
    "     - `consumer_thread` runs the `consumer` function as a **daemon** thread. A **daemon thread** runs in the background and will automatically stop when all non-daemon threads are done. It ensures that the program doesn't hang if the consumer is still running when there are no more items to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Starting Threads**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   producer_thread.start()\n",
    "   consumer_thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Both threads are started, allowing the producer to produce items and the consumer to consume them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Joining Threads**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   producer_thread.join()\n",
    "   data_queue.join()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `producer_thread.join()` makes the main program wait until the producer finishes producing all items.\n",
    "   - `data_queue.join()` waits until all the tasks in the queue have been processed (i.e., `task_done()` is called for all items).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Completion Message**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Processing complete\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Once both the producer has finished producing items and all items have been consumed, a final message \"Processing complete\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Code Works Together:\n",
    "1. **Producer Thread** starts, generating items and putting them into the queue.\n",
    "2. **Consumer Thread** continuously pulls items from the queue, consuming them.\n",
    "3. The main thread waits for the **Producer** to finish producing using `producer_thread.join()`.\n",
    "4. It also waits for all items in the queue to be processed with `data_queue.join()`.\n",
    "5. The **Consumer Thread** runs in the background as a daemon and automatically terminates when the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: The producer and consumer run concurrently, making the execution efficient.\n",
    "- **Thread Safety**: The `Queue` ensures that both threads (producer and consumer) can safely interact without needing explicit locking mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Daemon Thread**: The consumer thread is a daemon, ensuring it doesn't prevent the program from exiting once all items are consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Example:\n",
    "This structure is used in real-world applications such as:\n",
    "- A **web server** (consumer) handling multiple requests produced by clients (producers).\n",
    "- A **factory** where raw materials are produced (producer) and processed into products (consumer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The producer-consumer pattern helps balance workloads and ensures data flow between processes."

    "Here’s an explanation of the code and how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements a **Producer-Consumer** pattern using multiple **consumer threads** and one **producer thread**. This is an extended version where:\n",
    "- The producer generates a random number and places it in a shared queue.\n",
    "- The consumers retrieve numbers from the queue and process them.\n",
    "- After the producer has finished generating numbers, it sends a signal (`None`) to the consumers, indicating that production has stopped, and the consumers should terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Queue**:\n",
    "   - The `Queue` from the `queue` module is a thread-safe structure where the producer can place items and the consumers can remove items.\n",
    "   - The `Queue` ensures that multiple threads can safely interact with the shared data without the need for explicit locking mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Producer**:\n",
    "   The `Producer` is a subclass of the `Thread` class. It generates items and appends them to the queue.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Producer(Thread):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, queue):\n",
    "           Thread.__init__(self)\n",
    "           self.queue = queue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `queue.put(item)`: The producer places a randomly generated item into the queue.\n",
    "   - **Stopping Signal**: After producing 5 items, the producer places `None` into the queue multiple times (equal to the number of consumer threads). This acts as a signal to tell the consumers that no more items will be produced.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   self.queue.put(None)  # Signals the consumers to stop\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consumer**:\n",
    "   The `Consumer` class is also a subclass of the `Thread` class. Each consumer takes items from the queue and processes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Consumer(Thread):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, queue):\n",
    "           Thread.__init__(self)\n",
    "           self.queue = queue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `queue.get()`: Each consumer retrieves an item from the queue. If the item is `None`, the consumer interprets it as a signal to stop.\n",
    "   - The consumer uses the `task_done()` method after processing each item to signal that the task is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if item is None:\n",
    "       self.queue.put(None)\n",
    "       break  # Exits the loop and stops the consumer thread\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Thread Execution**:\n",
    "   - The `queue` is instantiated, and both the **Producer** and **Consumer** threads are created and started.\n",
    "   - There is one producer and three consumers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   t1 = Producer(queue)\n",
    "   t2 = Consumer(queue)\n",
    "   t3 = Consumer(queue)\n",
    "   t4 = Consumer(queue)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `t1.start()` starts the producer thread, and the consumer threads are started in a similar way.\n",
    "   - `t1.join()` ensures that the main thread waits for the producer and consumers to finish before proceeding. This prevents the main program from terminating prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Producer Starts**:\n",
    "   - The `Producer` thread generates 5 random items (integers between 0 and 256) and places them in the `queue`. After adding each item, the producer prints a message like:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Producer notify: item N°<random_number> appended to queue by <thread_name>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consumers Start**:\n",
    "   - Each of the 3 `Consumer` threads continuously retrieves items from the `queue` using `queue.get()`.\n",
    "   - When a consumer retrieves an item, it prints a message like:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Consumer notify: <item> popped from queue by <thread_name>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination Signal**:\n",
    "   - After producing all items, the producer places `None` into the `queue` three times (once for each consumer). \n",
    "   - When a consumer retrieves `None`, it understands that production is done and exits the loop. This allows the consumer threads to terminate gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Waiting for Completion**:\n",
    "   - The `join()` method ensures that the main thread waits for the producer and consumers to complete their work before printing:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     all tasks done.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is `None` used as a Stopping Signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `None` object acts as a special signal in this case. Since `None` is not a valid item produced by the `Producer`, it allows the `Consumer` threads to identify that production has finished. When a consumer encounters `None`, it breaks out of its infinite loop and terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Multiple Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "- The producer puts `None` into the queue three times (once for each consumer). Each consumer receives the `None` and exits after processing the items. This approach ensures that all consumers know when to stop, even though they are running concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The producer produces 5 items and places them into the queue.\n",
    "2. The consumers continuously take items from the queue and process them.\n",
    "3. After the producer finishes, it sends a termination signal (`None`) to each consumer.\n",
    "4. Once a consumer receives `None`, it stops processing and exits.\n",
    "5. The main program waits for all threads to finish and then prints \"all tasks done.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution effectively demonstrates thread synchronization and communication using `Queue` in Python for a producer-consumer model with multiple consumers."
